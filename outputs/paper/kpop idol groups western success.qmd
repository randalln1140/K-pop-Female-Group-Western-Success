abstract: "The debate of whether or not to cut police funding has gone on for ages. The propagators feared police brutalities due to the constant news portrayal, while others argued that police activity should be required to ensure people's safety. Recent news of violent crimes such as the stabbings in some of the TTC stations have highlighted the urgency of this issue; the topic of this debate is more relevant to us than we think. We can use data to settle this debate once in and for all, and they are critical for understanding the correlations between police expenditure and the number of solved reported crimes. In my analysis, I have compared divisions that have a steady increase of expenditure and their percentage of solved crime. The data has shown that more police expenses does not necessarily make their work more efficient. Furthermore, they are extremely bad at solving property related crimes. Therefore, the view held by proponents does have some merit, and the governing body should focus more of the expense on actual crime solving."
